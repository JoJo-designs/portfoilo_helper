            <p class="showText" >The task was to create a coffee table style book about a topic that 
                could be realistically turned into a book. I choose to make a book about colour. I 
                designed the book to be minimal so the colours could be the main focus. </p>

            <p class="showText" >The Designer Guide to colour would be a book that would be a good resource 
                for people who call themselves creatives and work in creative professions. All the text inside 
                this made up book is from another book about colour. All the text should be seen as 
                placeholder text. </p>

          <div class="text">The cover of the book is colourful. The front has a flower that had been edited
            to be many colours. The flower was boring on its own so I created a grid pattern with a black
            background the break the image up. One of the grid components is also filled in, this is where 
            I put the title and authors name. The back cover is a solid red orange colour with a picture of 
            colourful houses and a short description of the book. </div>

          <div class="text">The introduction page would be one of the first things a reader would see.
              I used a image of paint rollers on a plain white background and contrasted it by the opposite page
              which has a solid green background. The text on this page is near the bottom of the page to give 
            alot of breathing room for the readers eyes. A quote is placed above the main body text in larger red text.

          <img src="image/img4.jpg" style="width:100%" alt="Page inside the book the text on this page is about colour trends forecasting">
          <div class="text"> Some of  the pages that are in the center of the book also follow the same design principles
               as the first. The chapter opener for colour forecasting has a solid orange page contrasted 
               with a plain white page. An image of colourful umbrellas can also be found on this page. I picked image of 
               the umbrellas because it relate the word forecast.
