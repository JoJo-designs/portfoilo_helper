        <h1>Colour Book</h1>
        <p>The Designer Guide to colour is a book that would be a good resource for people who call 
        themselves creative and work in creative professions. all the text inside this made up book 
        is from another book about colour. All the text should be seen as placeholder text. </p>

                <p> When designing to cover of the book I wanted something simple and colourful 
                    The front has an image of a flower that has been edited to be rainbow colours. 
                    A grid with black boarders plus one square in the grid are black which add more 
                    more interest to the cover. The single black square is also where the text on the 
                    front cover is. The back cover is also simple, it is mostly a solid colour background 
                    which is broken up by an image of colourful houses and a short decription of the book.  </p>

                <p>The inside pages are also relatively simple but colourful. The introduction pages has 
                    an image of some paint rollers that make it look like the mostly white page is being 
                    painted. The other page is flooded with a bright green and the eyes are drawn to a 
                large Quote in a red-orange. Under the quote is some opening text. I keep most of the text 
             close to the bottom half of the page to leave a lot of white space for the eyes to rest on</p>

            <p> Chapter opener pages are similar to the introduction page. The first page has a coloured 
                background then followed with a white page. This particular chapter is about colour forecasts 
                and it features an image of colourful umbrellas which I think are part of an art installation 
                somewhere. I think that the image fit really well.
