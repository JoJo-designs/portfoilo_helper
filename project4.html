            <p class="showText">I completed this project after I had graduated college. The goal was to 
              create a set of flash cards about a topic that would be interesting. I like spooky stuff and I 
              create a set of card on folktale monsters from around the world. Each card needed an illustration
              and information that related.</p>

            <p class="showText"> The cards in black and white with shades of gray. The illustrations were 
              drawn by myself and are made up of two components. The illustration of the monsters which are 
              unique to each card. The second part a frame which would be a representation of the environment the 
              monster would be found in. The cave frame for cave dwelling monsters ect. These frames are not unique 
              to each card and I reused the same three frames. Doing this saved time and created a layed effect in 
              the images. The frames all have a tattered ribbon on the bottom the display the monsters name in a 
              black letter font</p>

            <p class="showText"> The back of the cards are simple an clean. The monsters name is displayed at the 
              top of the page and under that is the palace the legend originated from or believe to have originated 
              from. There is also a short paragraph about the monster these range from descriptions to stories and
              real world explanations that may explain where the legend began.

          <div class="text">This is one of the cards. The monster depicted is the Grootslang. Believed to be a combination of a snake and 
            elephant. The creature is said to dwell in a cave in south africa that locals claim is full of diamonds. The card uses the cave
            frame.

          <div class="text"> I draw the illustration with paper and ink. Each drawing is 4 inchs by two inchs. After I scanned them into the
             computer and vectorized them. which I did so I could remove the background easily. After I could layer them under the frame nicely.
