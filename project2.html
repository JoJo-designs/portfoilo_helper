            <p class="showText">The goal of this student project was to create the branding for a high end home 
                and decor store. The store would sell paint, wallpaper and home decor. </p>

            <p class="showText">Decora is a store that would specialize in home good and paints. The name 
                was inspired by a fashion style of the same name where more contrasting colours and accessories 
                is a must. It is very colourful and fun. The style is overly busy which doesn't really match the 
                final product. </p>

                <p class="showText">I choose to use round letters for this project. I think this gives it a youthful
                  look but still clean and professional. This is one of my favorite projects that I have worked on.  </p>

          <div class="text">This simple design was mostly just for my portfolio website. I am using it as the thumbnail 
              image for this project. I liked the way it turned out so I decided to display it alone with everything else.
              I think it would be good to use as a poster that is hung in the stores front window.

          <div class="text"> This is a cover for a booklet of colours that would be available. I wanted each booklet to 
              focus on one colour. I found this fantastic image of three different pink balloons on a pink background. 
              It was so pink that I couldn't help myself I had to use it. I remember when I first showed my teacher 
              she asked if I liked pink. I guess she was surprised by the pinkness that she saw before her. I was usually 
              wearing darker colours but I don't mind pink.

            <div class="text"> When I was researching for this project I found that many companies use well decorated rooms 
                painted in the colour with swatches of colours that are similar or match the colour. This does look nice, 
                however I didn't just want nice rooms in the colour. I wanted to create a focus on one colour and use pictures 
                that are very that colour. So in this case very pink.

            <div class="text"> I really enjoyed making the booklet so I did it again but this time in blue. I found an
                image of a jelly fish that screamed blue. This was not originally part of what I handed in. This was something I 
                did after the fact for the fun of it.

              <div class="text"> The inside of this book is very similar in layout of the other booklet. The design of 
                  the booklets is very clean. The top corners have a cut out that parallels the triangle in the logo. 
                  this cut out can be found on other minerals as well.

                <div class="text"> Another part of this assigned was to create paint chips. I looked at real paint chips to understand 
                  from other companies to understand what kind of thing I may need to put on them. I made single paint chips with a 
                  top corner cut out these are about the size of a business card. I also made colour scheme chip. these have a four 
                  colours that look nice together.
