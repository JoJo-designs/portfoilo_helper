            <p class="showText"> I love playing video games and when I had a chance to create a 
                luxury stationery set for any company I wanted. The choose was easy I did nintendo. 
                When I made this project the nintendo switch had only been out for about a year. This
                is purely a fan piece and is not real.
            </p>

            <p class="showText"> Being a luxury stationery set it needed to be super fancy. It can't 
                be seen in these mockups but it would have lots of features like metallic inks and
                embossing. It would also be printed on a thick card stock.  
            </p>

            <p class="showText"> I had a lot of fun with this project. It was very enjoyable.
                I was able to put down my love of video games on a school project which was cool.
                I did make a few edits from the original design.

          <div class="text">This layout displays all the part in one picture. The letter head has an image of mario in the bottom
              corner. This would be embossed and painted in a metallic red ink. on the back of the letter head is a design that 
              features images for some of nintendo's bigger game titles like the legend of zelda, mario and smash bros. (the key chain 
              wasn't made by me and is just the fill the awkward space).

          <div class="text"> One of the reasons I choose to use nintendo for this project was because I thought the switch 
              unique detachable controllers would make cool business cards (I was right these are really cool). The cards come 
              in a left and right variety matching the game system. The buttons are embossed to add texture and the die cut on 
              the top of the card give the cards the shape of the joy cons.
