            <p class="showText">This student projects goal was to create a guide book for a foreign city. 
              the guild booklet world need to fit in in a pocket and have an illustrated folding map. It 
              needs a table of content. Some kind of introduction page and a photo spread. 
            </p>

            <p class="showText"> this project sounded like a lot of fun. I was torn between doing Barcelona in spain
              and Tokyo. I had a hard time picking a city until I found the image on the cover. I liked the way it 
              looked and decided that I would do Tokyo.</p>

            <p class="showText"> The text inside the booklet is from a range of travel articles about tokyo. The text is to be 
              seen as a placeholder.

          <div class="text">The cover of the booklet is a brightly lit portion of the city. it is very colourful. The lights reflect off the water
            bringing even more colour to the image. the sides are busy so I keep the design element minimal to give room for the eyes to rest.

            <div class="text"> on the other side of the map is a second four page spread. This one serves as a introduction page. when folded in both halves 
              of the spread of could be read as individual spreads. I made a small test version to check how the page it would work but I need to add the pictures
              off it still.  I added a travel tip in a bright orange box to help break up some of the text.
