            <p class="showText">For this student project I was tasked to create the branding for an museum exhibit.
              the event would be held at the canadian museum of history. We could choose from a few exhibits that where
              currently running or would run in the future at the museum. I choose to the neanderthals exhibit not for 
              any particular reason just felt like it.
                 </p>

            <p class="showText"> I wanted the branding ot have organic feeling image. I wanted
              a cave paining look and used pink-ish orange colours as the main colours then used 
            blue the complement to orange to create a vibrant but also somewhat natural colour scheme.</p>

            <p class="showText"> I looked at some images of real cave painting. I decided that the best way 
              to capture the rough look was to hand draw them and scan them in and image trace. </p>

          <div class="text">This poster is used to advertise the event. The majority of the poster is 
            covered with a sorta crude hand drawing meant to look like a cave painting. The title of the event sits
            near the center in large text. Additional text that would help to explain what the event is about and 
            the date and location is at the bottom of the poster.

            this information incudes stuff like prices, hours of operation and upcoming closers. This page is not specific 
            to the exhibit. I created a grid of differently sized images on the top of the page to add some interest to 
            the design.

              has some more cave style drawings of a figure hunting a deer like creature. When I was doing research I learned
              that neanderthals were actually very intelligent and used complex tools. I used a bubble to separated this 
              information from the rest of the text to help tie the text and images together.

                was several banners that all make up an larger image. The banners depict a stampede of deer running across
                the banners. the deer are draw in in a cave painting style.
